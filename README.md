# Url Shortener Code Test

## Code test setup
cd into backend directory
```
yarn
yarn start
```

cd into frontend directory
```
yarn
yarn start
```
The project will automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

Enter your URL into the the input box, click *Shorten!* and you should be provided with the shortened URL below.

## Notes
- It's not completely finished but I tried to do my best to keep to the 2 hour time limit.
- I did have headphones on and blasted through it so there's not as many commits as I wanted.
- Although I'm more front end focused, creating the backend for this was something different so this was my first attempt in doing so and also using *Apollo*.
- The Frontend uses the *create-react-app* which I cleaned out to enable a quicker build time.
- Backend is pretty custom, no generator tools were used but I did us this [https://www.robinwieruch.de/node-js-express-tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/node-js-express-tutorial) as a starting point.

## What would I do differently
- Commit more often.
- Write tests to give good code coverage.
- Improve styling, error handling and refactor code (I've left logging in place to help whilst developing).
